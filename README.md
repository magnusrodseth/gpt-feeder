# GPT Feeder

## What is it?

One problem with GPT 3.5 was the lack of context of your code base, due to the low word limit on input. GPT-4 is capable of handling over 25,000 words of text, allowing for use cases like long form content creation, extended conversations, and document search and analysis [[1]](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4). Enter GPT Feeder.

GPT Feeder is a command-line application for collecting all your files in your code base into one text file, ready to be fed into ChatGPT-4.
